# Overview
This shows how to inherit ImageDataGenerator of TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha. As an example, cutout is implemented.

# Description
CustomImageDataGenerator inherited by ImageDataGenerator augments CIFAR-10 dataset and we can see the result. In this case, there are rotation, horizontal flip, zoom, and cutout as a kind of augmentation.

# Dataset
This dataset can be found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

# How to open it on Google Colaboratory
